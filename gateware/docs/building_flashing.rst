Building and Flashing
=====================

*Note: this section assumes you have already followed all steps in* :doc:`install`

Overview
--------

In the ``tiliqua`` repository, all top-level bitstreams that can be flashed to the hardware are located in `gateware/src/top <https://github.com/apfaudio/tiliqua/tree/main/gateware/src/top>`_. Each folder is a project, which may contain gateware, test harnesses, firmware (if it has a CPU) and additional command-line arguments.

In `gateware/pyproject.toml <https://github.com/apfaudio/tiliqua/tree/main/gateware/pyproject.toml>`_, there are some ``pdm`` command-line aliases set up to make these examples easier to type. For example, in this file we have a section like this:

.. code-block:: toml

    [tool.pdm.scripts]
    dsp = "src/top/dsp/top.py"

This means that when we run the command ``pdm dsp``, this will expand to a Python interpreter running the file ``src/top/dsp/top.py`` in the current virtual environment (using the dependencies we installed in :doc:`install`). There is nothing special going on here, it's just a shortcut for needing to type out the whole path every time. The following 2 commands are equivalent:

.. code-block:: bash

   # from `gateware` directory
   pdm dsp
   # or equivalently, not using the alias
   pdm run src/top/dsp/top.py

Building
--------

Each ``top.py`` has its own command-line interface. You can see the options by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   # from `gateware` directory
   pdm dsp -h

The available options change depending on which project you are building. For example, if a bitstream supports video, it will have an extra CLI option for ``--modeline``. If it supports different clock speeds, you will see an ``--fs-192khz`` option. If it has a CPU, you can pick where the firmware should be stored, and so on.

The `dsp/top.py` project contains lots of example cores demonstrating different parts of the DSP library. I encourage taking a peek through it. The project is structured that an extra CLI argument ``--dsp-core`` can be used to select which particular core to build. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Build example that just sends audio inputs to outputs unmodified.
   pdm dsp build --dsp-core=mirror

After a while, you should see something like:

.. code-block:: bash

As we have built a simple audio-only bitstream without a CPU, there are only 2 artifacts produced:

    - ``top.bit``: the synthesized bitstream to configure the FPGA
    - ``manifest.json``: Metadata about the bitstream, used to display the bootloader help screen, IO assignments, for example.

Both of these end up in ``build/dsp-mirror-r5/``, however, they are finally zipped together into ``dsp-mirror-9cd67c90-r5.tar.gz`` - which is a *Bitstream Archive*. This archive (bitstream + dependencies + metadata) is what can be flashed into a Tiliqua slot and seen by the bootloader.

.. note::

    For details on the format of these *Bitstream Archives* and how they are used, see :doc:`../bootloader`.

Logs and useful flags
---------------------

After building a bitstream, the most interesting log is found in ``build/<my_bitstream>/top.tim``. There you will find a resource utilization report (how much of the FPGA was used) as well as a timing report, both emitted by ``nextpnr-ecp5``.

When building bitstreams for ECP5, it's often the block RAMs, multipliers or combinational logic that is exhausted first, as shown in an excerpt from ``top.tim`` below:

.. code-block:: bash

    Info: Device utilisation:
    <...>
    Info: 	              DP16KD:       0/     56     0% # amount of block RAMs used
    <...>
    Info: 	          MULT18X18D:       1/     28     3% # amount of multipliers (DSP tiles) used
    <...>
    Info: 	          TRELLIS_FF:     731/  24288     3%
    Info: 	        TRELLIS_COMB:    1702/  24288     7% # amount of combination logic used
    Info: 	        TRELLIS_RAMW:      39/   3036     1%

Some more flags useful for development are:

    - ``--verbose``: print the ``yosys`` and ``nextpnr`` log output to the terminal while synthesis is happening.
    - ``--noflatten``: synthesize the design without flattening all modules together. This will lead to a larger, unoptimized design, but the benefit is that the Yosys logs ``build/<my_bitstream>/top.rpt`` will contain a separate synthesis report for each module in your design - so you can see roughly how many resources each component is using.
    - ``--debug-verilog``: dump a verilog translation of the entire project to ``build/<my_bitstream>/top.debug.v``. Note that normally, the Amaranth toolchain does not emit any verilog but instead translates your project directly into an intermediate language called RTLIL which is passed to Yosys. However, if you are familiar with verilog, this can be useful for understanding what is going on under the hood.

Rust manifest round-trip test and dependency MSRV
--------------------------------------------------

The flash test suite creates a temporary Cargo project and consumes
``tiliqua-manifest`` as a path dependency. Cargo does not use a library
dependency's own ``Cargo.lock`` in that situation, so a caret dependency can
resolve to a newer crate than a direct build of the library did. This can look
like a manifest serialization failure while the actual error is a newer
dependency requiring a newer Rust compiler.

Run the narrow compatibility test from ``gateware`` with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pdm run python -m pytest -q \
     tests/test_flash.py::TestFlashCommandGenerator::test_manifest_rust_compatibility -s

On 2026-08-17, the unused declaration ``fixed = "1.28.0"`` resolved to
``fixed 1.31.0`` in the temporary project, which required rustc 1.93 while the
host had rustc 1.92. Removing the unused direct dependency made the round-trip
test pass again. If a drifting dependency is genuinely required, declare and
test an explicit MSRV-compatible version policy rather than relying on the
library's lockfile to constrain downstream resolution.

Amaranth signature initial values
---------------------------------

With Amaranth 0.5.8, ``wiring.In`` and ``wiring.Out`` signature members use
``init=`` for their initial value. The older ``reset=`` keyword is deprecated;
using it emits a warning while collecting every gateware test, even if the
affected component is unrelated to the selected test. Replacing
``In(1, reset=0)`` with ``In(1, init=0)`` preserves the zero initial value and
removes the repository-owned warning. This is separate from reset-domain logic
such as ``ResetInserter`` and should not be used as a mechanical replacement
for a synchronous reset signal.

Background simulator stream cleanup
-----------------------------------

Reusable stream drivers often run as background simulator processes. If such a
process is cancelled while waiting in ``ctx.tick().until(...)``, Amaranth 0.5.8
can report ``aclose(): asynchronous generator is already running`` as a
``PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning``. The handshake may still pass, but the
warning obscures real failures and can appear under a later test during garbage
collection.

The stream helper now loops over one-shot edge samples instead:

.. code-block:: python

   while True:
       _, reset, ready = await ctx.tick().sample(stream.ready)
       if reset:
           raise DomainReset
       if ready:
           break

Simulator processes cannot use ``ctx.get()``; unlike ``until()``, awaiting a
sampled tick returns the clock-edge flag and reset flag before sampled values.
Preserving the reset check keeps the old ``DomainReset`` behavior. The same
pattern is used for ``valid`` plus payload on reads. A reusable
``stream.wait_until()`` keeps the same timing where a pre-handshake wait is part
of test behaviour, and direct ``repeat()`` calls in background processes use
explicit one-shot tick loops.

Do not delete a wait merely because it triggers the warning. Removing the
pre-wait from the PSRAM delay-line stimulus broke both zero/maximum-tap endpoint
profiles (the returned payload was zero instead of 5208). Replacing it with the
cancellable helper restored both profiles. FFT 17/17, the focused 42 delay/DSP/
raster tests, and the complete 130-test suite passed; full-suite warnings fell
from 94 to 31. The remaining warnings are dependency deprecations from LUNA,
not repository-owned unraisable async-generator warnings.

Flashing to a Bitstream Slot
----------------------------

A ``.tar.gz`` *Bitstream Archive* contains everything the bootloader needs to start a custom bitstream. You can build these yourself, or download pre-built archives from the `release page <https://github.com/apfaudio/tiliqua/releases>`_.

You can flash custom bitstreams to one of 8 slots, using the built-in ``pdm flash`` command. To flash a bitstream archive you have just built, you can use ``pdm flash archive`` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Flash user bitstreams to the desired slot (0-7)
   pdm flash archive build/dsp-mirror-r5/dsp-mirror*.tar.gz --slot 6
   # Same, without Y/N confirmation:
   pdm flash archive build/dsp-mirror-r5/dsp-mirror*.tar.gz --slot 6 --noconfirm

After flashing the above bitstream, you should see its name in the bootloader screen. You can then select it, and if you feed any audio/CV in on input channel 0, you will see it come out on output channel 0. As usual, you can hold the encoder for 3sec to return to the bootloader screen at any time.

.. note::

    If you want to avoid audio pops while flashing, it is best to flash from the bootloader bitstream, as the audio CODEC is always muted in that bitstream.

Webflasher
----------

Another option for flashing bitstreams is `tiliqua-webflash <https://apfaudio.github.io/tiliqua-webflash>`_, which lets you flash a bitstream archive from Chrome on any OS.

You can upload bitstream archives from your computer, or flash one from the server from the latest release package.

.. note::

    Generally, using the web flasher is a bit slower than using ``pdm flash``.

Flashing to SRAM
----------------

For simple bitstreams that don't have a CPU, it can be convenient to skip the whole 'permanently flash to a slot' procedure and instead write straight into the FPGA's configuration SRAM. This is much faster as it does not touch the SPI flash or persist permanently.

For our ``dsp-mirror`` example, here's an example of doing so:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ openFPGALoader -c dirtyJtag build/dsp-mirror-r5/top.bit

.. warning::

    Be careful when writing straight to SRAM that your audio and video clocks are exactly the same as what the bootloader was using, otherwise your bitstream won't start correctly. For audio-only bitstreams, this is the case if you don't use the ``--fs-192khz`` flag. For video bitstreams, your ``--modeline`` must match what the bootloader determined.

    If this sounds confusing, I would suggest always flashing to a Bootloader Slot, as it will guarantee things work as expected.

Flash Status
------------

``pdm flash`` also supplies a ``status`` command to read back the Tiliqua's SPI flash to see what is currently on there:

.. code-block:: bash

   pdm flash status

This will dump every manifest currently flashed to Tiliqua, so you can see what is flashed in which slot. This command simply does a readback, it does not write to the SPI flash.

Debug / Serial logs
-------------------

When Tiliqua is plugged in, you may notice some extra serial ports appear. Tiliqua's bootloader (and some user bitstreams, if they include a CPU) have a logger that will emit serial traffic on one of the FPGA pins.

By default, the RP2040 includes (in addition to the ``dirtyJtag`` adapter) a usb-to-serial CDC device. Upon opening it and restarting the bootloader (by holding down the encoder for 3sec), you will see a full log of some of the decision the bootloader has made, for example a list of all the bitstreams it found, any errors occuring during bitstream loading, or how it determined the current screen resolution. At the moment, only 115200 baud is supported. On Linux, I like to use ``picocom``, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0
   <... logs from Tiliqua appear here...>

However, you're free to use any serial client. Note that the special baud rate ``1200`` will reset the RP2040 and put it back in its bootloader. You probably don't want that under normal use, but it can be useful if you don't want unscrew Tiliqua from a rack to be able to press the BOOTSEL button for RP2040 updates. Technical details on the role of the RP2040 in the bootloading process and updating it can be found in :doc:`bootloader`
